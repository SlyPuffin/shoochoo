# ShooChoo
> ShooChoo (rhymes with Shoe and Chew) is created from the Japanese word for focus: 集中. ShooChoo To-Do is also hopefully fun to say.

ShooChoo is a Simple, Focus-focused To-Do App

## Concept
- A minimalist design was chosen to keep to-do lists from growing too much and becoming overwhelming.
- Committing to a task locks the page to a timer representing the estimated time to completion.
- Simple authentication is used for ease-of-use.
